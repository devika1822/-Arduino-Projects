# Bidirectional Visitor Counter and Automated Lighting System

Development and implementation of real time bidirectional visitor counter along with automatic lighting system using Arduino. It keeps track of visitors as well as takes over the control of the room lights. As a visitor enters the room, the count is incremented by one and lights are switched on. While the 
count is decremented if a person leaves the room. Lights are switched off when the last person leaves the room
In this project IR sensors, LCD display, relay etc were also used apart from Arduino.



# Obstacle Avoider 

An obstacle avoider car that using Arduino that uses ultrasonic sensors to detect the presence of obstacles in front of it and hence avoids collisions.

# Sensor Harp

A harp(musical instrument) with no actual strings, that produces music by obstructing the path of the ultrasonic sensors and gives out different notes based on the distance of the obstacle from the sensor.
